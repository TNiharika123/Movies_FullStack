A Netflix Clone built using Java on NetBeans with DerbyClient Database.
Here are some of the key functionalities that the project includes:

🔐 User Authentication: Users can sign in securely to access the Netflix Clone application. 
I've implemented a session invalidate() command to ensure that users can't access the homepage without signing in first, enhancing security and privacy.

❤️ Favourite Movies Section: Once signed in, users can add their favorite movies to a personalized "Liked Movies" section by simply clicking the heart icon on the movie displayed in the dashboard.
It's all about creating a user-friendly and engaging experience.

🗑️ Movie Deletion: Users also have the power to manage their liked movies by removing them from the "Favourite Movies" section with a simple click on the cross button. 
Flexibility is key!

🔍 Advanced Search Functionality: A powerful search feature allows users to find movies based on genre. 
The application retrieves and displays movie images, titles, and release years from the database, making it easy for users to discover new content they love.

🛠️ Tech Stack: I utilized Java and the NetBeans IDE for both the frontend and backend development. 
The database was powered by Derby Client to store and retrieve user data, ensuring a seamless user experience.
